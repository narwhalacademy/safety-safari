A simple card game interface to spice up online workshops where the faciliator walks their attendees through three digital safety scenarios. Feel free to customize it and use it in your own workshops!

## How to use

Note: Safety Safari assumes that the faciliator is sharing their screen on a desktop or laptop computer (it doesn't really work on phones or tablets very well).

- Download files into a local folder.
- Open `index.html` with a text or HTML editor of choice.
- Modify the three questions (they are marked in all caps) to ones that you want to use with your attendees.
- Save and close file.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser (in most cases, double clicking `index.html` will do the job).
- Double click on any card to reveal the question.
- Feel free to drag the cards around for dramatic effect.
